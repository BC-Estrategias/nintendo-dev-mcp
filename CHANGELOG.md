# Changelog

## 1.6.0 — DSi platform support
- **New platform: Nintendo DSi** (`agent/dsi`, BlocksDS/Wonderful Toolchain). Full feature parity with the 3DS agent on real hardware: the NDP protocol (read/write/list/stat), code-based and number-comparison pairing, the two-screen colored status UI with an activity log, the on-console folder access editor (**A**), the embedded web page, SD card free-space reporting, and a Wi-Fi network menu (**L**) that remembers up to 5 networks and reconnects on its own if the link drops. Wireless build updates over the agent's own `FS_WRITE` mean no physical SD-card swapping to iterate.
- Two real bugs found on real hardware, fixed in **shared** code (`agent/posix`), so the 3DS agent benefits too:
  - `ndp_posix_fs.c`: `lstat()`→`stat()` aliasing and the FAT symlink-containment bypass were only guarded for `__3DS__`, not the DSi's `__NDS__`, so `FS_WRITE`'s parent-directory check failed with a false `NOT_FOUND`.
  - `ndp_server.c`: `poll()` on this platform's dswifi/lwIP can permanently stop reporting a socket `POLLOUT`-ready once it has already been written to once outside of `poll()`'s own bookkeeping — silently stalling any multi-frame transfer (a file read, the web page's body) past its first chunk. Fixed generally: output is no longer gated on `POLLOUT` at all, which is free when idle and a no-op change on platforms where `POLLOUT` already worked (3DS, host).
- The web page's copy was hardcoded for the 3DS (paths, button names, a Wi-Fi speed figure, a 3DS-CFW-specific troubleshooting note) despite being served by both agents from the same bundle. It now picks a `<key>.<platform>` override via the HELLO response's platform field when one exists, falling back to the original text otherwise — covering the FAQ, the pairing screen, and a few status messages.
- Publisher branding in both agents is now "BC Labs" (was "BC Estrategias"; the DSi build had never set one, so BlocksDS's own project URL leaked into TWiLight Menu++ / flashcart loaders).
- Known DSi limits: no firmware version or system/app memory reporting (bare-metal homebrew, no OS to ask); Wi-Fi transfers run at ~0.15–0.2 MiB/s (slower than the 3DS's ~0.6–1 MiB/s); an R4i Gold flashcart's own loader fails to associate to Wi-Fi (SD access and the network scan both work) on both a DSi and a DS Lite — untested on other flashcart brands.

## 1.5.5 — leftover old description fixed
- `APP_DESCRIPTION` in the Makefile still said "remote dev agent" (shown in the Homebrew Launcher / HOME Menu's suspended-software info) after the rename to NSD Bridge. Now "wireless SD card bridge".

## 1.5.4 — renamed build artifacts
- Build artifacts renamed from `nintendo-dev-agent*` to `nsd-bridge*` (3DS target, CIA, SMDH, RSF), matching the project's new name. `scripts/build-3ds-cia.sh` now also copies the CIA to a version-less `dist/nsd-bridge.cia`, so `github.com/BC-Estrategias/nsd-bridge/releases/latest/download/nsd-bridge.cia` always resolves to the current release without editing a QR code or link every time.

## 1.5.3 — GitHub repository renamed
- The repository moved to `BC-Estrategias/nsd-bridge`; the web page's FAQ links (GitHub, MCP install path) now point there. GitHub redirects the old `nintendo-dev-mcp` URL, but new links use the new name directly.

## 1.5.2 — renamed to NSD Bridge
- The project is renamed from Nintendo Dev Agent / Nintendo Dev MCP to **NSD Bridge**, to reflect it growing past its original 3DS-only MCP scope: a web file manager (the flagship feature), CLI, and MCP server, with DSi and Switch support planned (the portable `agent/common` core was designed for this from the start). Every place that showed the old name now shows the new one: the console's own screen, the CIA title (Home Menu, FBI), the Home Menu banner, the web page (title, header, FAQ), and the MCP/CLI help text and error messages. Internal identifiers (the NDP protocol name, the `ndev` CLI command, C/TypeScript symbol names) are unchanged — this is a display-name change, not a protocol or tooling break.

## 1.5.1 — new icon
- Custom Home Menu icon and web page favicon. No functional changes.

## 1.5.0 — paired devices management
- **View and remove paired devices** on the Settings page: a new card lists every computer or browser paired with the console, even ones not connected right now, and lets you forget any of them from the page. Two protocol commands, `PAIR_LIST` and `PAIR_FORGET` (spec-compatible additions, existing clients unaffected): any authenticated device may list and prune the console's full pairing list, mirroring the trust an opened folder already grants and the SELECT×2 "forget all" already on the console. `ndp_keystore_remove` compacts the on-console key store in place (file format unchanged). Covered by new C unit tests and a TypeScript integration test against the real host agent binary over TCP (pair two devices, list, cross-device forget, revocation on the next connection, self-forget without dropping the live session).
- Footer with "Desenvolvido por BC Labs" and links to GitHub and Instagram.
- Fixed a syntax error in the page's Portuguese/English dictionaries (curly quotes used as string delimiters) that left the page blank whenever it was regenerated; `scripts/check.sh` now syntax-checks every page script.

## 1.3.0 — first release with the web page
(1.2.0–1.2.2 were test builds that were never published; everything below is new in this release.)
- **Web page served by the console.** The 3DS app serves a file manager on port 8080 (address on the top screen; **R** turns it off/on): browse the SD card, view images, edit text files (atomic save, optional `.bak`), **drag and drop** files and folders to upload (SHA-256 checked by the console, conflict handling), download, plus Settings (device, SD and memory, opened folders, pairing, preferences) and an FAQ with the local MCP install steps. Portuguese and English, light/dark, phone friendly (one tap opens folders; checkboxes select). Same pairing, modes and folders as the CLI: the page cannot change any of them.
- **Organize:** checkbox selection, cut / copy / paste, *Move to…* / *Copy to…* with a folder picker, drag onto a folder to move, keyboard shortcuts, a **Trash** shortcut, restore, and **Delete forever / Empty trash**.
- New commands: `FS_RENAME` (0x0032, `ndev mv`, MCP `nintendo_fs_move`), `FS_PURGE` (0x0034, `ndev purge`; deletes for good but **only inside a trash**, in batches, DEVELOPMENT mode; not exposed through the MCP), `FS_COPY` (0x0035, `ndev cp`; the console copies one file in bounded steps and renames it into place, never overwrites; folders are copied file by file by the page).
- NDP over WebSocket (spec §15) with Host/Origin checks against DNS rebinding and cross-site use; the raw NDP client and the page are independent, so the MCP server keeps working while the page is open. Two tabs no longer fight over the connection (the replaced one is told, WebSocket close 4001).
- **The pairing store never says "full":** it now holds 8 pairings, a new pairing with the same name (the same browser pairing again) replaces its old key, and when it is full the oldest one is dropped (the console names it in the prompt before you press A). Before, a full store refused everything until SELECT×2 wiped all of them.
- **Pairing by number comparison** (`PAIR_BEGIN`/`REVEAL`/`POLL`): press Y on the console, click *Pair* on the page (or run `ndev pair`), and press **A** on the console when both screens show the same 6-digit number. No code to type. X25519 + a commitment (so the number cannot be ground by an attacker); the key never crosses the network. Implemented three times (C, TypeScript with node:crypto, the page in BigInt JavaScript) and checked against RFC 7748 and an independent Python reference. The 16-character code still works (`ndev pair --code`).
- The page ships its own SHA-256/HMAC (plain `http://` has no `crypto.subtle`), verified against the same test vectors as the C and TypeScript implementations. A refused stored key is no longer deleted from the browser; the pairing code field formats itself and pairs as soon as it is complete.
- Large downloads are assembled in 8 MiB blocks (the browser can keep them on disk) with a percentage; uploads warn about files of 4 GiB or more (FAT32) and about not enough free space.

## 1.1.1
- The 3DS agent no longer reports `app_mem_*` (it always read 0 free of the agent's own 64 MB mode, which is misleading). Found on the first hardware run of `DEVICE_INFO`.

## 1.1.0
- `DEVICE_INFO` (0x0010): console model, firmware, RAM, memory regions and SD card total/free space. `ndev info`, and `nintendo_device_info` now returns them (fields the console cannot measure are absent, never guessed).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-09-25
First release for other people.
- The agent **starts READ_ONLY** (press X on the console to allow writes). `NDEV_DEV=1` builds a developer flavour.
- Pairing with per-frame HMAC, folders chosen on the console (default: only `/3ds/nintendo-dev-agent`), `ACCESS_INFO`, `/luma/plugins` and `/luma/titles` writable exceptions inside the protected `/luma`.
- CIA build (`scripts/build-3ds-cia.sh`), CLI `ndev pair/access`, MCP `nintendo_device_info` lists the opened folders.
- CI: Linux case-sensitivity test fixed; retries for the devkitPro package download.
- Research kept for reference: 3GX plugin inside a game and Game Notes applet replacement (see `docs/research/`); neither ships.

## 0.6.x
Owner-chosen folders (0.6.0), stack-usage fix (0.6.1), `/luma/plugins` + `/luma/titles` exceptions (0.6.2), menu shows the effective level (0.6.3).

## 0.5.0
Pairing and authenticated frames.

## 0.1–0.4
Protocol core, read-only file access, atomic writes, trash, MCP server.
